# Set Up

## After The Invite  
After the bot has joined your server, run `pin.check` to make sure Pinboard has all the permissions  
  
## The Pinboard Channel  
• Create a channel called `#pinboard`  
• I strongly suggest you have the following permissions for said channel:  
`@everyone`

`Pinboard`

Run `pin.check` to make sure Pinboard can find the channel, then go on!  
Pin a message. You're done.

# Database Update  
The new database update requires a little more than that...  
First, make sure everything is up-to-date by running `pin.dbstats`.  
If it's correct, you should have something like this:  
![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/eb408329f13326df9a3e40e2a1a4580b.png)  
Do you have that? If not, please report it.  
## Setting Up Your Database  
If you want to completely set up your database, you'll either need to be the owner or be an admin. Or just have the `Manage Server` permission. Any way works.  
### The Guild  
Ah yes, the mighty guild. It holds many members. It also doesn't need a lot when it comes to this database yay!  
The only guild-specific command is `pin.setping`. You'll need the `Manage Server` permission for this. The arguments are as follows:  
  
  * `everyone` - Ping everyone every time a pin is sent to the pinboard!  
  * `here` - Just ping here.  
  * `none` - Don't ping at all. Screw you, pings.  
  
## All Done!  
Run `pin.check` to make sure Pinboard can find the channel, then go on!  
Pin a message. You're done.
